# Apply permutation examples

Mini repo demonstrating the `apply_permutation` technique, as popularised by Raymond Chen (_all credit for the core implementation goes to him_).

My additions include a fold expression to sort multiple parallel arrays, and array offsets for applying a permutation to a subrange.

For more information see these excellent blog posts by Raymond Chen.
